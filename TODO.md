# TODO

- Add error handling system for if the input file doesn't follow syntax, currently it causes undefined behavior.
- redo all comments program-wide
- Allow the correct answer to be shown in questions after the user has gotten the question wrong.
- Strange bug if there is just one or two words in the wordset
- Migrate as much as possible in the algorithm and wordset classes to the stack
- make part of speech an unchangable variable again
